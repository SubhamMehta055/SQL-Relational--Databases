What is RDBMS?

A relational database refers to a database that stores data in a structured format, using rows and columns. This makes it easy to locate and access specific values within the database. It is "relational" because the values within each table are related to each other.
Example of RDBMS : MySQL,MS SQL Server, Oracle ,IBM DB2 etc.


What is MySQL?

MySQL, pronounced either "My S-Q-L" or "My Sequel," is an open source relational database management system. It is based on the structured query language (SQL)  which is used for adding, removing, and modifying information in the database. 

Many database-driven websites that use MySQL also use a Web scripting language like PHP to access information from the database. MySQL commands can be incorporated into the PHP code, allowing part or all of a Web page to be generated from database information. Because both MySQL and PHP are both open source (meaning they are free to download and use), the PHP/MySQL combination has become a popular choice for database-driven websites.
